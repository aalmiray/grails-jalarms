This is a Grails plugin to enable the use of the jAlarms library. It uses only the jalarms-core dependency; if you want to use additional channels (such as mail, nagios, xmpp) you must include jalarms-channels yourself.

And of course you have to include jalarms-aop if you want to use the @AlarmOnException annotation.
